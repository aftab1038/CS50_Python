# `CS50: Introduction to Programming with Python`

I made this repository to post my solutions for the problems of Harvard University's "CS50: Introduction to Programming with Python" course.  
You can find the materials for this course [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/).  
I hope this is helpful to other students! If you find it useful, please leave a star!  
Every exercise in this repository scored 100% on submission.

## DISCLAIMER

Please don't just copy the code mindlessly without trying to solve the problems yourself. It's totally pointless if you actually want to learn how to write software and a blatant violation of the [**Academic Honesty**](https://docs.cs50.net/2016/fall/syllabus/cs50.html#academic-honesty) policy of the course.
